# fixed a dumb bug in the function ps_product_attributes::cartGetAttributes
	(allowed to add products without choosing attributes)
^ moved ACL code for 'show_prices' authentication into ps_perm::prepareACL()
^ moved cart initialization code into a new constructor for ps_cart
^ moved Session initialization code into ps_session::initSession(); a new constructor calls this on class instantiation

Authorize.net Payment Module
for use with mambo-phpShop
#############################

Authorize.net integration was added in version 1.2 RC2 of mambo-phpshop
using Authorize.Net's Advanced Integration Method (AIM) using 
cURL with OpenSSL to send and receive information securely.
Read Authorize.Net implementation guides to better understand 
how to implement it.

Security:
This Implementation mets the requirements of certificated Shopping Carts as
required in authorize.net's Shopping Cart Certification Program.

    *   Supports all NAME/VALUE pairs of the Authorize.Net API for submitting credit card 
        and eCheck.Net transactions to the Authorize.Net Payment Gateway. 
    *   Supports all NAME/VALUE pairs of the Wells Fargo SecureSource gateway specification 
        that also runs on the Authorize.Net payment platform. 
    *   Passes the x_tran_key (merchant transaction key) field with each transaction. 
    *   Protects the merchant transaction key by 
        - storing it encrypted in the database,
        - restricting Access to Admin/Storeadmin Users only,
        - requiring the User's password for viewing and changing it,
        - storing it on another place as the Login ID and
        - passing it through the internet using SSL connections ONLY
    *   Documents its security/protection policy for sensitive merchant information 
        such as transaction payment information, the merchant login ID, and the merchant transaction key. 
    *   Commits to maintain compatibility with new features and requirements of the Payment Gateway in order 
        to maintain certification.
    *   Commits to provide and maintain current contact information for future communication with Authorize.Net.

Requirements:
- PHP 4.0.2 or later, with cURL extension (with OpenSSL support).

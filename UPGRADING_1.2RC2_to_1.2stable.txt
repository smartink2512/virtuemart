UPGRADING 
mambo-phpShop 1.2 RC2 TO mambo-phpShop 1.2 stable

MANUAL INSTALLATION
mambo-phpShop 1.2 stable


ABOUT THIS FILE
-----------------
This file is meant to provide hints on the Upgrading and Manual Installation Procedure
for mambo-phpShop 1.2 stable.


ABOUT mambo-phpShop 1.2 stable
------------------------------
mambo-phpShop 1.2 stable comes with some important new features.

For European Users the most important will be the Basket showing all Prices including tax 
(when the Shopper Group has set its Flag "Show Prices including Tax" to >Yes<). 
The Tax then is shown as (...including x.xx € Tax)

There have been some changes to the database and a lot of bugs have been fixed.
The bugs which have been found & fixed and the new features let me strongly recommend 
everyone to upgrade to this new version immediately!


INSTALLATION (for Upgraders & new Installations)
--------------------------------------------------
1. The same words everytime:
   * BACKUP YOUR EXISTING FILES 
	  AND 
	 YOUR DATABASE FIRST. 
	 (How do you want to recover your working version when something goes wrong?)
  
  You can use this component for Backing up your Mambo site:
  http://mamboforge.net/projects/bigapebackup/
  
2. Unpack the archive file (the one which contains this file):

	com_phpshop_x.x_UPDATE_and_MANUAL_INSTALLATION_PACKAGE.tar.gz
	
	You should now see two directories:
	  * administrator
	  and
	  * components
	
	The directory structure in those directories is the
	same as in your Mambo site.
	Open up an FTP Connection to your site and upload
	both directories to your Mambo site.
	
	/components
	to
	  /path-to-mambo-root/components/

	/administrator
	to
	  /path-to-mambo-root/administrator/
	  
	This will overwrite existing files in the directories
	  * /components/com_phpshop
	and
	  * /administrator/components/com_phpshop
	
	Your configuration file will not be overwritten.


3a. NEW manual INSTALLATION 
	
	* Login in to the Mambo Administration (the so-called Backend).
	  http://www.xxxxxx.com/administrator/
	
	* When having logged in, you see this URL in the address bar:
	  http://www.xxxxxx.com/administrator/index2.php
	
	* Now just add "?option=com_phpshop" after index2.php, so it looks like this
	  in your browser's address bar:
	  
		http://www.xxxxxx.com/administrator/index2.php?option=com_phpshop
	
	  and submit (press Enter).
	
	* You should now see the "Installation was successful..." Screen.
	  There you can click on 
		"GO TO THE SHOP >>" 
	  or on
		"INSTALL SAMPLE DATA" (when you want to have some sample products and categories in your Shop).

	* That's it.
	
	
3b. For UPGRADERS
	
	* Login in to the Mambo Administration
	* Select "mambo-phpShop" from the Components Menu
	* You should now see the "Installation was successful..." Screen.
	  
	  There you can click "UPGRADE FROM 1.2 RC2 >>"

Zone Shipping Module – Country Version 1.0 

This module was born out of the frustrations of many phpShoppers not being 
able to solve a simple shipping problem. 
“How do I calculate shipping without the InterShipper module?”
Since most phpShoppers use either flat rate shipping or zone shipping, I decided 
to write a module that would serve both. This module works on the premise that each 
country is a zone, and each zone has a Shipping Cost per Item and a Shipping Limit to each zone.
This is by no means the end all solution! Read that again. Contemplate the implications 
for your specific application.
While this module will solve a couple of problems, shipping is much more complex 
than what is supplied in this module. 

HOWEVER

This module does provide some interesting options for expansion and many of them have 
already been implemented. We do offer a larger COMMERCIAL version of this module that 
is distributed on a case by case basis as it need to be customized to your specific needs. 
While it can be done rather easily, there is still time involved and therefore it is not free.

Credits
The first major credit goes to all of the phpShop developers. Without them, I would have been 
forced to write the whole application myself. They have done a great job with this project from day one.
